Enterprise Template | Creation of a high quality conversational experience requires a foundational set of capabilities. To help you succeed with building great conversational experiences, we have created an Enterprise Bot Template. This template brings together all of the best practices and supporting components we've identified through building of conversational experiences. This template greatly simplifies the creation of a new bot project and includes basic conversational intents, Dispatcher integration, QnAMaker, Application Insights, PowerBI insights and fully automated deployment | [View Template](/CSharp/core-SendAttachment)


# Solutions

------------ | ------------- | :-----------:
Custom Assistant | We have seen significant need from our customers and partners to deliver a conversational assistant tailored to their brand, personalized to their customers and made available across a broad range of conversational canvases and devices. Continuing Microsoft open-sourced approach toward Bot Framework SDK, the open source Custom Personal Assistant provides full control over the end user experience built on a set of foundational capabilities. Additionally, the experience can be infused with intelligence about the end-user and any device/ecosystem information for a truly integrated and intelligent experience. To increase developer productivity and to enable a vibrant ecosystem of reusable conversational experiences, we are providing developers initial examples of reusable conversational skills. These skills can be added into the conversational application to light up a specific conversation experience, such as finding a point of interest, interacting with calendar, tasks, email and many other scenarios. Skills are fully customizable and consist of language models and code.  | [View Sample](/CSharp/core-SendAttachment)
