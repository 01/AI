# Custom Assistant Language Support

## Overview

Natural Language Understanding is at the core of a Custom Assistant. The LUIS Cognitive Service is used throughout the Custom Assitant and Skills hence you can refer to the [LUIS supported languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-supported-languages) to understand the foundational language availablity at this time.

In-line with customer prioritisation we have prioritised English, French, Italian, German and Spanish languages for the language models made available through the Custom Assistant along with the Language Generation (responses). Additional language support is in planning and can be prioritised according to customer demand.
